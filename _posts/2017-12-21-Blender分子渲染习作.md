分子可视化软件千千万, GaussView, VMD, PyMOL, Chimrea等各有各的特点, 也各有各的用户群. 萝卜青菜, 各有所爱, 也没有必要非争个一二三四, 你强我弱. 但这些软件渲染的图片看多了也不免审美疲劳, 难觉再爱, 所以就有人专门用那些小众的渲染程序, 特别是那些原本不是为生物和化学分子准备的程序, 如POVRAY, Blender之类. POVRAY吧, 其实用的还多些, 因为很多分子可视化软件都可以输出对应的POVRAY文件. 但Blender在分子方面的曝光率就少得多了, 因为这个软件的复杂度比前面那些高不少, 非3D建模方面的人很难掌握. 就是用, 也只使用最简单的功能. 更复杂漂亮的, 大多要专门花钱请人给做效果了. Blender复杂虽是复杂, 但要想渲染那些照片级别的图片, 还真得试试.

最近看了一些Blender的相关资料, 练习了一下, 就把习作放在这里给大家审丑吧.

# 博士前/博士后

## Postdoctoral Position Reaction Dynamics & Planetary Sciences, University of Hawaii at Manoa, USA

- 2017年12月20日 下午9:51

The Reaction Dynamics Group, Department of Chemistry & W.M. Keck Research Laboratory in Astrochemistry, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, invites applications for one postdoctoral position. The appointment period is initially for one year, but can be renewed annually based on avail­a­b­ility of funds and satisfactory progress as defined by first author publications. The salary is competitive and commensurate with experience. Successful applicants should have a strong background in experimental reaction dynamics, UHV tech­nology, and pulsed (tunable) laser systems. Experience in labview programming and/or Autocad/SolidWorks is desirable. The goal of the experiments is to probe the formation of complex organic molecules in Solar System ices and/or the synthesis of water on the moon via interaction of ionizing radiation with low temperature ices and silicates, respectively. Reaction products will be probed via tunable vacuum ultraviolet photoionization generated via four wave mixing schemes.

Solid communication skills in English (written, oral), a publication record in internationally circulated, peer-reviewed journals, and willingness to work in a team are man­da­to­ry. Only self-motivated and energetic candidates are encouraged to apply. Please send a letter of interest, three letters of recommendation, CV, and publication list to Prof. Ralf I. Kaiser, De­partment of Chemistry, University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822-2275, USA [ralfk@hawaii.edu]. Applicants must demonstrate their capability to prepare manuscripts for publications independently. The review of applications will start January 15, 2018, and continues until the position is filled. A description of our current research group can be found at http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/Bil301/welcome.html. Only complete applications will be reviewed.

## PhD position at the FELIX Laboratory

### Project description:

Vibrational signatures of reactive intermediates in interstellar chemistry

Molecular ions are important drivers of the chemistry in astrophysical environments and are also of fundamental interest in quantum chemistry. However, due to their reactive nature, they are difficult to study with standard spectroscopic methods. In our group we are developing sensitive action spectroscopic techniques to overcome these obstacles, and apply them to astrophysically relevant molecular ions, providing the spectral fingerprints needed to detect new species in space.
The focus of the PhD project is to measure vibrational signatures of a targeted set of reactive hydrocarbon and nitrile cations. You will develop, prepare and perform spectroscopic experiments using a unique combination of a state-of-the-art cryogenic ion trap instrument interfaced to the widely tunable IR free electron lasers of the FELIX Laboratory. The spectroscopic studies will be guided and interpreted by high-level quantum-chemical calculations. You will also be involved in developing and improving the experimental setup to enable kinetic studies on ion-molecule reactions in tandem with spectroscopic probing of the reaction products.

### Requirements

- We are looking for a highly motivated candidate holding (or expecting to receive) a Master’s degree or equivalent in (Astro-/) Physics, Chemistry or a related field.
- Experience with experimental work, in particular in the fields of gas phase laser spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy under ultra-high vacuum conditions is highly desirable.
- The ability to work both independently and within a team is a key asset.
- The working language is English.
- Willingness to (occasionally) work outside office hours.

### Work environment:

As a PhD candidate, you will be embedded at the FELIX Laboratory (http://www.ru.nl/felix/) at Radboud University (Nijmegen, The Netherlands) working with Dr. Sandra Brünken in the research line in molecular astrophysics and cold ion spectroscopy. The FELIX Laboratory is an international user facility operating intense, short-pulsed infrared and THz free electron lasers for research of matter, providing a tuning range between 3 and 1500 μm. In user experiments the infrared radiation of the FELIX lasers interacts with molecules and materials, revealing detailed information about 3D structure, functional properties and electronic properties.
Moreover, the FELIX Laboratory is a large research infrastructure and welcomes external users from all over the world to perform research projects with FELIX. As a PhD student, you will also assist external users and participate in collaborative projects at the cryogenic ion trap user station. The FELIX Laboratory is a part of the Faculty of Science at the Radboud University.

### More information and Application:

The deadline for application is January 14, 2018; the start date of the PhD contract can be as early as March 2018.
